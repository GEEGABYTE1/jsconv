### Full npm script reference


#### npm run build

Cleans the build folder, copies squarespace files (jsont, less, assets folder content) into the build folder, runs webpack to build the template javascript.

#### npm run watch

Runs build, then watches the source folder for changes to squarespace files and javascript, automatically updating the built template for each change.

#### npm start [-- options]

Runs watch, and simultaneously launches sqs-server. By default this runs on localhost:9000. If you want to use another port use the command:

```
npm start -- -p PORT
```

#### npm run deploy [-- options]

Deploys your built template to production using git. If not already configured, initializes a git repo for deployment in your build folder. Note this is separate from your source repository, and will only contain the production built template.

By default your deployment will be commited with just a timestamp message. If you want to provide a custom message use the command:

```
npm run deploy -- -m "your message"
```
